A collection of short scripts to be used with the [obs-shaderfilter plugin](https://github.com/exeldro/obs-shaderfilter) for OBS Studio:
```
OBS shaders are written in HLSL.
Note that the .shader and .effect extensions are for clarity only, and have no specific meaning to the plugin. Text files with any extension can be loaded. In a standard, .effect files include a vertex shader and .shader only has a pixel shader.
```

As the newer plugin [obs-shaderfilter-plus](https://github.com/Limeth/obs-shaderfilter-plus) also supports HLSL, these files should theoretically work with that as well (but I have not yet tested this).
